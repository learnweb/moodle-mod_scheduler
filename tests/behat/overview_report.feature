  Scenario: The Scheduler activity index redirect to the activities overview
    Given the site is running Moodle version 5.0 or higher
    When I am on the "C1" "course > activities > scheduler" page logged in as "admin"
    Then I should see "Name" in the "scheduler_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Actions" in the "scheduler_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Test scheduler"

  Scenario: View a group scheduler in the activities overview
    Given the site is running Moodle version 5.0 or higher
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity  | name                 | intro | course | idnumber     | groupmode |
      | scheduler | Group test scheduler | n     | C1     | schedulerVis | 2         |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I add 5 slots 11 days ahead in "schedulerVis" scheduler and I fill the form with:
      | Location  | Here |
    When I am on the "C1" "course > activities > scheduler" page logged in as "admin"
    Then I should see "An overview of all activities in the course"
    And I should see "Name" in the "scheduler_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Actions" in the "scheduler_overview_collapsible" "region"
    And I should see "Group test scheduler"

  Scenario: Use the selected grouping in the activities overview
    Given the site is running Moodle version 5.0 or higher
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | groupscheduling | 1 | mod_scheduler |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity  | name                 | intro | course | idnumber     | groupmode |
      | scheduler | Group test scheduler | n     | C1     | schedulerVis | 0         |
    And I am on the "schedulerVis" "scheduler activity editing" page logged in as "admin"
    And I set the field "Booking in groups" to "Yes, in grouping Grouping 1"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    When I am on the "C1" "course > activities > scheduler" page
    Then I should see "Group test scheduler"
    And I should see "1 of 1 groups"
    And I should not see "2 of 2 groups"
