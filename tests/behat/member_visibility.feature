Feature: Control the visibility of students booked into Scheduler slots
  In order to protect the information of students
  As a teacher
  I need to control who can see the members of a slot

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:

      | student2   | Student        | 2        | student2@example.com   |
      | student3   | Student        | 3        | student3@example.com   |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user       | course | role           |
      | teacher1   | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1   | C1     | student        |
      | student2   | C1     | student        |
      | student3   | C1     | student        |
    And the following "groups" exist:
      | name    | course | idnumber |
      | Group A | C1     | GA       |
      | Group B | C1     | GB       |
    And the following "group members" exist:
      | user       | group |
      | student1   | GA    |
      | student2   | GA    |

    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity  | name           | course | idnumber  |
      | scheduler | Test Scheduler | C1     | scheduler |
    And I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as teacher1
    And I navigate to "Settings" in current page administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Booking in groups         | Yes, for all groups          |
      | Default member visibility | Only visible to slot members |
    And I click on "Save and return to course" "button"
    And I add a slot 5 days ahead at 800 in "scheduler" scheduler and I fill the form with:
      | Location                      | Large office |
      | exclusivity                   | 5            |
    And I log out

  Scenario: Slot members can see each other
    When I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student1
    And I select "Group A" from the "appointgroup" singleselect
    And I click on "Book slot" "button" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"
    Then I should see "Cancel booking" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I should see "Student 2" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"

  Scenario: Students outside the slot cannot see the members
    Given I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student1
    And I select "Group A" from the "appointgroup" singleselect
    And I click on "Book slot" "button" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I log out

    When I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student3
    Then I should not see "Student 1" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I should not see "Student 2" in the "8:00 AM" "table_row"

  Scenario: Slot members cannot see other members of an anonymous slot
    Given I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as teacher1
    And I add a slot 5 days ahead at 900 in "scheduler" scheduler and I fill the form with:
      | Location                      | Large office |
      | exclusivity                   | 5            |
      | Member visibility of the slot | Anonymous    |
    And I log out

    When I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student1
    And I select "Group A" from the "appointgroup" singleselect
    And I click on "Book slot" "button" in the "9:00 AM" "table_row"
    Then I should see "Cancel booking" in the "9:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I should not see "Student 2" in the "9:00 AM" "table_row"

  Scenario: All course students can see the members of a slot if the slot member visibility is set to "Visible"
    Given I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as teacher1
    And I add a slot 5 days ahead at 1000 in "scheduler" scheduler and I fill the form with:
      | Location                      | Large office |
      | exclusivity                   | 5            |
      | Member visibility of the slot | Visible      |

    When I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student1
    And I select "Group A" from the "appointgroup" singleselect
    And I click on "Book slot" "button" in the "10:00 AM" "table_row"
    Then I should see "Cancel booking" in the "10:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I should see "Student 2" in the "10:00 AM" "table_row"
    And I log out

    When I am on the "scheduler" Activity page logged in as student3
    Then I should see "Student 1" in the "10:00 AM" "table_row"
